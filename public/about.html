        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Heyy!!😀 
        I am Satya from India🇮🇳. I currently graduated from my high school and am aspiring to study undergrad in USA. I have already received some admission offers but waiting for some more to finally decide the university I want to go. The thing which is becoming a very big barrier is the fees. So if anyone is ready to give some help and be a sugar daddy, I would happily take it hahaha😆.. </p>

        <p>I am interested in business, sports like cricket🏏, football⚽️ and some others. I have also started learning programming like web development languages and Python3. But the thing I like the most is to connect with new people and learning new things as well as getting new experiences.</p>

<p>Those are some simple things about me and my life right now. I would love to know more about you. Hope you are doing really great and you keep that up even if you are going through some bad sh*ts in life just remember.. you deserve to be where you are today! And you have reached there from your skills, abilities and ideas. Trust in yourself. Be positive. The path down the road may not be easy but it will be worthwhile🤍</p>

<p>P.s. forgot to add.. I am a very big fan of watching TV shows and movies. Marvel, Harry Potter, Stranger Things, etc. You name it!😂</p>
